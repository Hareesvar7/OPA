To create an Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy that checks S3 bucket policies for specific grantee permissions, you need to ensure that the bucket policy adheres to the security requirements set by NIST. This policy is essential for controlling who has access to the bucket and what permissions are granted, aligning with controls such as **AC-3** (Access Enforcement) and **AC-6** (Least Privilege).

### Key Considerations for Grantee Checks:
1. **Defined Grantees**: Specify which grantees (AWS accounts, users, or groups) should not be included in the bucket policy.
2. **Deny Requests**: If a bucket policy includes a grantee that is not allowed, the policy should deny the request and provide a clear message.

### **Rego Policy: `s3_bucket_policy_grantee_check.rego`**

```rego
package aws.s3

# Default deny all actions
default allow = false

# Define the set of allowed grantees (AWS Account IDs or Principal ARNs)
allowed_grantees = {
    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/allowed-user",
    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/allowed-role"
}

# Allow if the bucket policy does not include disallowed grantees
allow {
    input.method == "s3:PutBucketPolicy"
    not disallowed_grantee_in_policy(input.bucket_policy)
}

# Deny if the bucket policy includes disallowed grantees
deny[{"msg": msg}] {
    input.method == "s3:PutBucketPolicy"
    disallowed_grantee_in_policy(input.bucket_policy)
    msg = sprintf("The bucket policy contains a disallowed grantee.")
}

# Helper function to check if any disallowed grantee is present in the bucket policy
disallowed_grantee_in_policy(bucket_policy) {
    some statement
    statement.Principal[_] == grantee
    not grantee_in_allowed_list(grantee)
}

# Helper function to check if a grantee is in the allowed list
grantee_in_allowed_list(grantee) {
    grantee in allowed_grantees
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **allowed_grantees Set**: This set defines the grantees (specified by their AWS Account IDs or Principal ARNs) that are permitted to access the bucket.

- **allow Rules**: The `allow` rule permits the action of setting a bucket policy as long as no disallowed grantees are found in the bucket policy.

- **deny Rules**: If an attempt is made to set a bucket policy that includes a disallowed grantee, the corresponding `deny` rule will trigger, preventing the action and providing a message indicating that the bucket policy is not compliant.

- **disallowed_grantee_in_policy Function**: This helper function checks whether any of the grantees in the bucket policy are not in the allowed list.

### **Example Input JSON:**
Here's an example of how the input JSON would look for evaluating the policy. This represents a request to set a bucket policy:

```json
{
    "method": "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
    "bucket_policy": {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/allowed-user"
                },
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::987654321098:user/disallowed-user"
                },
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### **Example Input (Compliant Policy):**
```json
{
    "method": "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
    "bucket_policy": {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/allowed-user"
                },
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### **Running the Policy:**
To evaluate this policy using OPA, run the following command:

```bash
opa eval --input input.json --data s3_bucket_policy_grantee_check.rego "data.aws.s3.allow"
```

If the bucket policy includes a disallowed grantee, the policy will deny the request and provide a message like:

```bash
opa eval --input input.json --data s3_bucket_policy_grantee_check.rego "data.aws.s3.deny"
```

The output will state why access was denied, such as:

```
The bucket policy contains a disallowed grantee.
```

### **NIST SP 800-53 Alignment:**
This policy helps align with NIST controls, specifically:
- **AC-3**: Access Enforcement – Ensures that access to the bucket is limited to authorized grantees.
- **AC-6**: Least Privilege – Maintains that only necessary permissions are granted to specified users and roles.

### **Periodic Enforcement:**
To enforce this policy periodically, you can automate checks (e.g., via AWS Lambda or within your CI/CD pipeline) to ensure that S3 bucket policies are compliant with the defined grantee checks.

If you need further refinements or additional rules aligned with specific NIST controls, feel free to ask!
