To enforce an OPA policy that ensures **S3 account-level public access blocks** are enabled periodically (following NIST guidelines), you would need to check that all public access blocks are set properly at the account level. These blocks help prevent public access to all S3 buckets within the AWS account, enforcing controls such as **NIST SP 800-53 AC-3** (Access Enforcement) and **SC-7** (Boundary Protection).

### Key Considerations for Public Access Blocks:
The following public access block settings need to be checked:
1. **BlockPublicAcls** – Blocks new public ACLs and replaces any public ACLs on buckets and objects.
2. **IgnorePublicAcls** – Ignores any public ACLs on buckets and objects.
3. **BlockPublicPolicy** – Blocks new public bucket policies and prevents existing buckets from becoming public.
4. **RestrictPublicBuckets** – Restricts access to buckets with public policies to only AWS service principals and authorized users.

### **Rego Policy: `s3_account_public_access_blocks.rego`**

```rego
package aws.s3

# Default deny rule if any of the public access blocks are not enabled
default allow = false

# Allow if all public access block settings are enabled
allow {
    input.method == "s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock"
    public_access_block_enabled(input.public_access_block_configuration)
}

# Deny with detailed message if any setting is not enabled
deny[{"msg": msg}] {
    input.method == "s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock"
    not public_access_block_enabled(input.public_access_block_configuration)
    msg = "S3 account-level public access block settings are not fully enabled"
}

# Helper function to check if all public access blocks are enabled
public_access_block_enabled(cfg) {
    cfg.block_public_acls == true
    cfg.ignore_public_acls == true
    cfg.block_public_policy == true
    cfg.restrict_public_buckets == true
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **allow Rule**: The `allow` rule ensures that all four public access block settings (`block_public_acls`, `ignore_public_acls`, `block_public_policy`, and `restrict_public_buckets`) are enabled at the account level.
  
- **deny Rule**: If any of these settings are not enabled, the `deny` rule will return a message stating that public access blocks are not fully enabled.
  
- **public_access_block_enabled Function**: This helper function checks each required setting to verify that public access is properly blocked across the account.

### **Example Input JSON:**
Here’s an example of a JSON input that would be used to evaluate the policy, representing the `GetAccountPublicAccessBlock` call to check account-level public access block settings.

```json
{
    "method": "s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock",
    "public_access_block_configuration": {
        "block_public_acls": true,
        "ignore_public_acls": true,
        "block_public_policy": true,
        "restrict_public_buckets": true
    }
}
```

### **Example Input (with Incorrect Settings):**
```json
{
    "method": "s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock",
    "public_access_block_configuration": {
        "block_public_acls": true,
        "ignore_public_acls": false,
        "block_public_policy": true,
        "restrict_public_buckets": true
    }
}
```

### **Running the Policy:**
To evaluate this policy with OPA, use the following command:

```bash
opa eval --input input.json --data s3_account_public_access_blocks.rego "data.aws.s3.allow"
```

This will return `true` if all public access blocks are properly enabled.

If any settings are not enabled, you can run the deny rule to see why the policy failed:

```bash
opa eval --input input.json --data s3_account_public_access_blocks.rego "data.aws.s3.deny"
```

It will provide a message like:

```
S3 account-level public access block settings are not fully enabled
```

### **NIST SP 800-53 Alignment:**
This OPA policy helps align with the following NIST controls:
- **AC-3**: Access Enforcement – Ensuring that S3 buckets are not accessible to the public.
- **SC-7**: Boundary Protection – Protects AWS account boundaries by enforcing public access blocks.
- **AU-2** and **AU-12**: As part of audit generation and reporting, these controls can help ensure proper logging and alerting when settings are misconfigured.

### **Periodic Enforcement:**
To enforce this periodically, you would schedule this policy check as part of your compliance monitoring (e.g., via a CI/CD pipeline or a regular AWS Lambda function that runs this policy). You can automate the `s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock` call and evaluate the policy periodically to ensure compliance over time.

If you need more specific alignment with a particular NIST control or further customizations, let me know!
