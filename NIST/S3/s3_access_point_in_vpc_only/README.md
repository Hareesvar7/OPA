To create an Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy that enforces S3 Access Points to be used only within a VPC, you can ensure that any requests to create or modify S3 Access Points are restricted to those that are configured to operate exclusively within a specified VPC. This policy aligns with NIST guidelines by enforcing proper network boundaries and access control, particularly focusing on controls like **AC-4** (Information Flow Enforcement) and **SC-7** (Boundary Protection).

### Key Considerations for VPC-Only Access Points:
1. **VpcConfiguration**: The Access Point must be associated with a specific VPC.
2. **Deny**: Any attempts to create or modify Access Points without the VPC association should be denied.

### **Rego Policy: `s3_access_point_in_vpc_only.rego`**

```rego
package aws.s3

# Default deny all actions
default allow = false

# Allow if the Access Point is configured to be used only within a VPC
allow {
    input.method == "s3:CreateAccessPoint"
    access_point_in_vpc_only(input.access_point)
}

allow {
    input.method == "s3:PutAccessPointPolicy"
    access_point_in_vpc_only(input.access_point)
}

allow {
    input.method == "s3:UpdateAccessPoint"
    access_point_in_vpc_only(input.access_point)
}

# Deny if the Access Point is not configured to be used only within a VPC
deny[{"msg": msg}] {
    input.method == "s3:CreateAccessPoint"
    not access_point_in_vpc_only(input.access_point)
    msg = sprintf("Access Point %s must be configured to be used only within a VPC", [input.access_point.name])
}

deny[{"msg": msg}] {
    input.method == "s3:PutAccessPointPolicy"
    not access_point_in_vpc_only(input.access_point)
    msg = sprintf("Access Point %s must be configured to be used only within a VPC", [input.access_point.name])
}

deny[{"msg": msg}] {
    input.method == "s3:UpdateAccessPoint"
    not access_point_in_vpc_only(input.access_point)
    msg = sprintf("Access Point %s must be configured to be used only within a VPC", [input.access_point.name])
}

# Helper function to check if the Access Point is configured for VPC only
access_point_in_vpc_only(access_point) {
    access_point.vpc_configuration != null
    access_point.vpc_configuration.vpc_id != ""
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **allow Rules**: The `allow` rules permit actions if the Access Point is configured to be used exclusively within a specified VPC. 

- **deny Rules**: If an attempt is made to create or modify an Access Point that is not associated with a VPC, the corresponding `deny` rule will trigger, preventing the action and providing a message indicating that the Access Point must be configured for VPC usage.

- **access_point_in_vpc_only Function**: This helper function checks whether the Access Point has a valid VPC configuration.

### **Example Input JSON:**
Here's an example of how the input JSON would look for evaluating the policy. This represents a request to create an S3 Access Point:

```json
{
    "method": "s3:CreateAccessPoint",
    "access_point": {
        "name": "my-vpc-access-point",
        "vpc_configuration": {
            "vpc_id": "vpc-12345"
        }
    }
}
```

### **Example Input (with Invalid Configuration):**
```json
{
    "method": "s3:CreateAccessPoint",
    "access_point": {
        "name": "my-non-vpc-access-point",
        "vpc_configuration": null
    }
}
```

### **Running the Policy:**
To evaluate this policy using OPA, run the following command:

```bash
opa eval --input input.json --data s3_access_point_in_vpc_only.rego "data.aws.s3.allow"
```

If the Access Point is not configured for VPC usage, the policy will deny the request and provide a message like:

```bash
opa eval --input input.json --data s3_access_point_in_vpc_only.rego "data.aws.s3.deny"
```

The output will state why access was denied, such as:

```
Access Point my-non-vpc-access-point must be configured to be used only within a VPC
```

### **NIST SP 800-53 Alignment:**
This policy helps align with NIST controls, specifically:
- **AC-4**: Information Flow Enforcement – Ensures that data flows only through the appropriate network channels (in this case, VPC).
- **SC-7**: Boundary Protection – Protects the AWS environment by ensuring that S3 Access Points are only accessible within a VPC, minimizing exposure to public internet traffic.

### **Periodic Enforcement:**
To enforce this policy periodically, you can automate checks (e.g., via AWS Lambda or within your CI/CD pipeline) to ensure that all S3 Access Points are configured to be used only within a VPC.

If you need further refinements or more detailed rules aligned with specific NIST controls, feel free to ask!
