To create an Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy that prohibits the use of S3 Bucket ACLs (Access Control Lists) in alignment with NIST guidelines, you can enforce that all S3 buckets must not use ACLs for access control. This aligns with best practices for security, minimizing the risk of misconfiguration, and follows NIST controls like **AC-3** (Access Enforcement) and **AC-6** (Least Privilege).

### Key Considerations for Prohibiting Bucket ACLs:
1. **No ACLs**: Ensure that any attempts to set or modify bucket ACLs are denied.
2. **Focus on Policies**: Instead, all access control should be managed through bucket policies or IAM policies.

### **Rego Policy: `s3_bucket_acl_prohibited.rego`**

```rego
package aws.s3

# Default deny all actions
default allow = false

# Allow if no ACL modifications are attempted
allow {
    input.method == "s3:CreateBucket"
}

allow {
    input.method == "s3:PutBucketPolicy"
}

allow {
    input.method == "s3:DeleteBucketPolicy"
}

# Deny if any attempt is made to set or modify ACLs
deny[{"msg": msg}] {
    input.method == "s3:PutBucketAcl"
    msg = sprintf("Setting ACLs on buckets is prohibited.")
}

deny[{"msg": msg}] {
    input.method == "s3:PutObjectAcl"
    msg = sprintf("Setting ACLs on objects is prohibited.")
}

deny[{"msg": msg}] {
    input.method == "s3:PutBucketAcl"
    msg = sprintf("Setting ACLs on buckets is prohibited.")
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **allow Rules**: The `allow` rules permit bucket creation and policy modifications as long as no ACLs are set or modified.

- **deny Rules**: If there are any attempts to set or modify bucket or object ACLs, the corresponding `deny` rule will trigger, preventing the action and providing a message indicating that setting ACLs is prohibited.

### **Example Input JSON:**
Here's an example of how the input JSON would look for evaluating the policy. This represents a request to create an S3 bucket:

```json
{
    "method": "s3:CreateBucket",
    "bucket": {
        "name": "my-secure-bucket"
    }
}
```

### **Example Input (with Prohibited ACL Setting):**
```json
{
    "method": "s3:PutBucketAcl",
    "bucket": {
        "name": "my-secure-bucket",
        "acl": "public-read"
    }
}
```

### **Running the Policy:**
To evaluate this policy using OPA, run the following command:

```bash
opa eval --input input.json --data s3_bucket_acl_prohibited.rego "data.aws.s3.allow"
```

If an attempt is made to set an ACL on a bucket or object, the policy will deny the request and provide a message like:

```bash
opa eval --input input.json --data s3_bucket_acl_prohibited.rego "data.aws.s3.deny"
```

The output will state why access was denied, such as:

```
Setting ACLs on buckets is prohibited.
```

### **NIST SP 800-53 Alignment:**
This policy helps align with NIST controls, specifically:
- **AC-3**: Access Enforcement – Ensures that access to S3 buckets is controlled and managed through policies rather than ACLs.
- **AC-6**: Least Privilege – By prohibiting ACLs, the policy enforces least privilege principles, reducing the risk of overly permissive access.

### **Periodic Enforcement:**
To enforce this policy periodically, you can automate checks (e.g., via AWS Lambda or within your CI/CD pipeline) to ensure that no S3 buckets are configured with ACLs.

If you need further refinements or additional rules aligned with specific NIST controls, feel free to ask!
