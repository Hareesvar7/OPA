Here is the requested **single policy** combining various AWS Config management rules for S3 from **S3-access-point-only-in-vpc** to **S3-version-lifecycle-policy-check**. I'll also include the necessary **JSON data** to simulate Terraform-like S3 bucket configurations, and the **Rego policies** to be executed using OPA eval.

### Rego Policy (Combined)

```rego
package aws.s3

# Rule 1: S3-access-point-only-in-vpc
deny[{"bucket": bucket.name, "rule": "S3-access-point-only-in-vpc", "message": "Access point is not restricted to VPC"}] {
  bucket := input.buckets[_]
  bucket.access_point.vpc == false
}

# Rule 2: S3-bucket-default-lock-enabled
deny[{"bucket": bucket.name, "rule": "S3-bucket-default-lock-enabled", "message": "Object Lock is not enabled"}] {
  bucket := input.buckets[_]
  not bucket.lock.enabled
}

# Rule 3: S3-bucket-logging-enabled
deny[{"bucket": bucket.name, "rule": "S3-bucket-logging-enabled", "message": "Logging is not enabled"}] {
  bucket := input.buckets[_]
  bucket.logging.enabled == false
}

# Rule 4: S3-bucket-public-read-prohibited
deny[{"bucket": bucket.name, "rule": "S3-bucket-public-read-prohibited", "message": "Public read access is enabled"}] {
  bucket := input.buckets[_]
  bucket.acls.read == "public"
}

# Rule 5: S3-bucket-public-write-prohibited
deny[{"bucket": bucket.name, "rule": "S3-bucket-public-write-prohibited", "message": "Public write access is enabled"}] {
  bucket := input.buckets[_]
  bucket.acls.write == "public"
}

# Rule 6: S3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled
deny[{"bucket": bucket.name, "rule": "S3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled", "message": "Server-side encryption is not enabled"}] {
  bucket := input.buckets[_]
  bucket.encryption.sse_algorithm == ""
}

# Rule 7: S3-version-lifecycle-policy-check
deny[{"bucket": bucket.name, "rule": "S3-version-lifecycle-policy-check", "message": "Versioning is not enabled"}] {
  bucket := input.buckets[_]
  bucket.versioning.enabled == false
}

deny[{"bucket": bucket.name, "rule": "S3-version-lifecycle-policy-check", "message": "No lifecycle policy is configured for versioned bucket"}] {
  bucket := input.buckets[_]
  bucket.versioning.enabled == true
  count(bucket.lifecycle_rules) == 0
}
```

### Explanation of Each Rule:

1. **S3-access-point-only-in-vpc**: Ensures that the S3 access point is restricted to a VPC.
   - The policy checks whether `access_point.vpc == false`. If true, a denial message is returned.

2. **S3-bucket-default-lock-enabled**: Ensures that S3 Object Lock is enabled.
   - The policy checks if `lock.enabled` is missing or `false`.

3. **S3-bucket-logging-enabled**: Ensures that logging is enabled for S3 buckets.
   - It checks if `logging.enabled == false` and raises a denial if logging is disabled.

4. **S3-bucket-public-read-prohibited**: Ensures no public read access for the S3 bucket.
   - It checks if the bucket ACL allows public read (`acls.read == "public"`).

5. **S3-bucket-public-write-prohibited**: Ensures no public write access for the S3 bucket.
   - It checks if the bucket ACL allows public write (`acls.write == "public"`).

6. **S3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled**: Ensures that server-side encryption is enabled.
   - It checks if `encryption.sse_algorithm == ""`, meaning no encryption algorithm is defined.

7. **S3-version-lifecycle-policy-check**: Ensures that versioning is enabled and there are lifecycle policies configured.
   - The first part checks `versioning.enabled == false` to ensure versioning is enabled.
   - The second part checks if there are any lifecycle policies for the bucket with versioning enabled.

### Running the Policies with OPA Eval

To evaluate these policies with **OPA eval**, you can run the following command:

```bash
opa eval --input s3_buckets.json --data . 'data.aws.s3.deny'
```

This command will evaluate the **input** JSON (simulating your S3 bucket configurations) against the **Rego policies** stored in your working directory.

---

### Adding New Policies

To extend the policy set:
1. Add a new Rego rule within the `aws.s3` package.
2. Modify the **input JSON** to include new configurations.
3. Re-run the `opa eval` command to test the new policies.

---

### Conclusion

These **combined policies** ensure that your S3 buckets comply with a range of **AWS Config management rules**, from access controls (VPC access points) to data protection mechanisms (versioning, lifecycle rules, encryption). You can adjust and extend these policies to meet additional compliance and security requirements.
